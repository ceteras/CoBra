# CoBra

CoBra is a Z80 computer designed in 1986 at a research center in Brasov, Romania (ITCI).

This repo is a "revival" approach, aiming to re-create the computer in Kicad.

Many thanks to [cobrasov.com](https://cobrasov.com/CoBra%20Project/index.html), my main inspiration source in this endeavour.
